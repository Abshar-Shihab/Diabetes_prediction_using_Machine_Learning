# Diabetes_prediction_using_Machine_Learning
The Diabetes Prediction Project uses a machine learning approach to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on key health-related metrics. The project explores data preprocessing, feature scaling, and classification techniques using Python libraries.




# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health-related parameters. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, training, and evaluation of a classification model.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic illness that requires early detection for effective management. This project employs machine learning to analyze and classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using a structured dataset. The pipeline is designed to process input data, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The project uses the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical data for patients. The features include:

- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes likelihood based on family history
- `Age`: Patient's age
- `Outcome`: Target variable (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

The dataset is small and relatively clean, making it suitable for beginners in machine learning.

## Prerequisites

The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Workflow

1. **Load Dataset**:
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.

2. **Explore Dataset**:
   - Examine structure, summary statistics, and value distributions.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Standardize features for uniform scale using `StandardScaler`.

4. **Split Data**:
   - Partition the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Train a machine learning classifier on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate accuracy on both training and test sets.

7. **Make Predictions**:
   - Use the trained model to predict the diabetes status for new inputs.


## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: ~X%
- **Testing Accuracy**: ~Y%

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Place the `diabetes.csv` dataset in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the Python script using:
   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```
4. Test the model by providing custom input data.

## Future Enhancements

- Use additional classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
- Add data visualization to enhance exploratory analysis.
